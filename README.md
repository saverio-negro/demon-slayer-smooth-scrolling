# Demon Slayer Smooth Scrolling

<p>Demon Slayer Smooth Scrolling is a project I dedicated quite a great amount of effort towards.</p>

<p>It essentially uses two handful API's in order to significantly amplify the UX (User Experience).</p>

<h2>Intersection Observer API</h2>

<p>The first API being the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API#intersection_observer_concepts_and_usage">Intersection Observer API</a>, which serves to trigger a desired callback function to perform whatever operation you need to, whenever the observer object detects any intersection between the viewport and the target element. I won't be here bothering you explaining all the details related to that Application Programming Interface. However, you'll find more at the link bringing you over to the MDN Web Docs.</p>

<h2>Smooth Scrolling API</h2>

<p>The second API being <a href="https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll">the Smooth Scrolling API</a>, which I don't own, but you can find more about the author by taking a look at the link I shared with you. The Smooth Scrolling API served me to provide a smooth scrolling effect when hyper-referencing the various HTML section elements; in other words, when the user clicks on any of the links related to the character names, it brings you to that section within the page via a smooth transition, instead of abruptly.</p>

<h2>Mouse Cursor Effect</h2>

<p>Alongside the JavaScript code written to implement and adapt the API, I have also written additional JavaScript code to implement a new custom cursor, and work with various CSS animations.</p>
<br>
<p>You might wonder why I based my project on an anime. Well, other than the fact of being fond of anime's, and particularly Demon Slayer, I also thought that making a webpage on an anime would turn out to be quite challenging - especially when it comes to improving the User Experience (UX), providing correct animations, and contributing with so much creativity without overdoing, but keeping your project simple enough.</p>

<p>All in all, I truly hope that you end up liking it.</p>
<p>See you on the next project. „Åò„ÇÉ„Åæ„Åü„Å≠ (ja mata ne), see you then. üôÇ</p>
