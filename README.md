# Demon Slayer Smooth Scrolling

<p>Demon Slayer Smooth Scrolling is a project I dedicated quite a great amount of effort towards.</p>

<p>It essentially uses two handful API's in order to significantly amplify the UX (User Experience).</p>

<p>The first API being the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API#intersection_observer_concepts_and_usage">Intersection Observer API.</a>, which serves to trigger a desired callback function to perform whatever operation you need to whenever the observer object detects any intersection between the viewport and the target element. I won't be here bothering you explaining all the details related to that Application Programming Interface. However, you'll find more at the link bringing you over to the MDN Web Docs</p>

<p>The second API being <a href="">the Smooth Scrolling API</a></p>
